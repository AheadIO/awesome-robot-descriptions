# Contributions Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure of the following:

- Check that the corresponding model is not already in the list.
- You believe the model is **awesome**. This list is a curation, not a collection. You or another contributor should have used the model, and would personally recommend it.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggested model.
- Use the following format for the link to the model: ``[MODEL-NAME](REPO-LINK) - DESCRIPTION. (FORMAT) [website](WEB-LINK)``
- Keep descriptions short and simple. End them with a full stop/period.
- Links should point to a repository on GitHub/GitLab that is, in order of preference:
    1. Usable and easy to grab (e.g. just the URDF is better than Xacro scripts).
    2. Up-to-date and maintained.
    3. Contains only the model (rather than a bigger project).
    4. Is the original source rather than a fork.
- Format can be URDF, MJCF, XML, ...
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- Optionally, add a picture to the gallery of the corresponding category.
    - The picture should be square, its display size should be 100px by 100px.
    - It should only depict the robot model, preferably a 3D visualization over transparent or white background.
- Model files should come from a legal source and be legally distributed.
- Order models alphabetically within each category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Every link and contribution, no matter how large or small, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps us gather useful resources in one place.

## Updating your PR

Making a PR adhere to the above standards can be difficult. If maintainers notice anything that needs to be improved, they will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can improve your PR so that it can be merged.

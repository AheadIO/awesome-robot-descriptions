# Contributions Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure of the following:

- Check that the corresponding model is not already in the list.
- You believe the model is **awesome**. This list is a curation, not a collection. You or another contributor should have used the model, and would personally recommend it.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggested model.
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

## Link format

Use the following format for the link to the model:

```
* [Model name](link) (format): short description.
```

- Model name should be short, e.g. "JVRC" over "Japanese Virtual Robotic Challenge humanoid model".
- Link should point, in order of preference, to:
    1. An up-to-date repository on GitHub/GitLab.
    2. A model-only repository rather than a bigger project.
    3. The original source rather than a fork.
- Format can be URDF, MJCF, XML, ...
- Description may include the model's author(s), number of degrees of freedom, type of actuators (if it corresponds to a real robot), ...
- Optionally, add a picture to the gallery of the corresponding category.
    - The picture should be square, its display size should be 100px by 100px.
    - It should only depict the robot model, preferably a 3D visualization over transparent or white background.
- Model files come from a legal source and are legally distributed.

Every link and contribution, no matter how large or small, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps us gather useful resources in one place.

## Updating your PR

Making a PR adhere to the above standards can be difficult. If maintainers notice anything that needs to be improved, they will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can improve your PR so that it can be merged.

# Contributions Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure of the following:

- Check that the corresponding model is not already in the list.
- You believe the model is **awesome**. This list is a curation, not a collection. You or another contributor should have used the model, and would personally recommend it.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggested model.
- Use title-casing (AP style).
- Use the following format for the link: [List Name](link)
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.
- Model files come from a legal source and are legally distributed

Every link and contribution, no matter how large or small, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps us gather useful resources in one place.

## Updating your PR

Making a PR adhere to the above standards can be difficult. If maintainers notice anything that needs to be improved, they will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can improve your PR so that it can be merged.

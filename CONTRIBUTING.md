# Contributions Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure of the following:

- The corresponding model is not already in the list.
- You believe the model is **awesome**. This list is a curation, not a collection.
- Use the following format for the link to the model: ``[MODEL-NAME](REPO-LINK) - DESCRIPTION. (FORMAT) [website](WEB-LINK)``
- Keep descriptions short and simple. End them with a full stop/period.
- Links should point to a repository on GitHub/GitLab that is, in order of preference:
    1. Usable and easy to grab (e.g. just the URDF is better than Xacro scripts).
    2. Up-to-date and maintained.
    3. Contains only the model (rather than a bigger project).
    4. Is the original source (rather than a fork).
- Format can be URDF, MJCF, XML, ...
- Model files should come from a legal source, and be legally distributed.
- Models are sorted alphabetically within each category.
- Remove trailing whitespaces.

Every link and contribution, no matter how large or small, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps us gather a directory of useful robot models.

## Adding a picture to the gallery

Optionally, you can add a picture to the gallery for a given model:

- The picture should be square, it should display well when rescaled at 100px by 100px.
- It should only depict the robot model, preferably a 3D visualization over transparent or white background.

## Updating your PR

Making a PR adhere to the above standards can be difficult. If maintainers notice anything that needs to be improved, they will ask you to edit your PR before merging it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can improve your PR so that it can be merged.
